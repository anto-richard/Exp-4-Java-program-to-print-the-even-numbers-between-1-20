## AIM:

To write a java program to print the even numbers between 1-20.

## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1:

Import the necessary packages.

### Step 2:

Initialize a variable i as 2 and set a for loop.

### Step 3:

Check the number is even or not using if else statement.

### Step 4:

Print the even numbers between 1-20.

### Step 5:

End the program.

## PROGRAM:

```java

Name : Anto Richard. S
Register Number : 212221240005
Java program to print the even numbers between 1-20.

```

```java

public class EvenNumbers
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
            {
                System.out.print(i+"\t");
            }
        }
    }
}

```

## OUTPUT:

![o4](https://github.com/anto-richard/Exp-4-Java-program-to-print-the-even-numbers-between-1-20/assets/93427534/0ccea137-9f24-474d-b7af-322cd6c5e7d6)

## RESULT:

Thus the java program to print the even numbers between 1-20 is written and implemented successfully.
